Comparison Table

The table below shows the accuracies of each sampling technique on five different machine learning models. The dataset used for all models is a balanced version of the original unbalanced dataset using random over-sampling and under-sampling techniques.

Sampling Technique	Decision Tree	SVM	Logistic Resgression	KNN	Naive Bayes
Simple Random Sampling	0.9778	0.8954	0.8917	0.8915	0.7275
Systematic Sampling	0.9813	0.8989	0.9213	0.9493	0.6854
Stratified Sampling	0.9851	0.8937	0.9217	0.9498	0.6890
Cluster Sampling	0.9868	0.9000	0.9088	0.9691	0.9235
Convenience Sampling	0.9849	0.9190	0.9322	0.9623	0.7740
